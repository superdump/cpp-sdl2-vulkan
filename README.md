# Cross-Platform Computer Graphics Base Project

This isn't intended for general usage yet. It is mostly a dumping ground for
bits and pieces as I find useful libraries and learn patterns and such for my
education.

I am embarking on learning real-time computer graphics and wanted to have a
clean and consistent starting point based on the following languages, libraries
and technologies:

- C++11
    - Could bump up to C++14 or C++17 easily
- CMake
    - De facto standard cross-platform build system for C++ graphics projects
- SDL2
    - Very commonly used library for interactive audiovisual projects providing
      APIs for input events, display and sound output
- Vulkan
    - Modern, cross-platform graphics API

## Code from elsewhere

I used code from @corngood's https://github.com/corngood/SDL_vulkan for the init
and loop functions.
